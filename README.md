# 6306Case_Study1
Team Variance (consisting of Steven Cocke, Terry Johnson, and Brandon de la Houssaye) has been commissioned by Client X to analyze and interpret certain data covering beer and breweries across all states with the United States in America.

In particular, Client X has requested that Team Variance address the following questions:

1. How many beer breweries are located in each state?
2. What is the median alcohol level for beer ("ABV") by state?
3. What is the median beer bittnerness ("IBU") by state?
4. What state has the highest observed ABV?
5. What state has the highest observed IBU?
6. What are the summary statistics across all states for ABV?
7. Lastly, is there an apparent relationship between ABV and IBU?

For the last request made by Client X (number 7 above), Team Variance will provide guidance using visual tools.  That is, perceived correlation between ABV and IBU will be addressed using data visualization tools (such as a scatterplot) and not through an advanced statistical analysis (e.g., a regression analysis of the variables ABV and IBU).  Hereinafter, reference to the variables, ABV and IBU, will be collectively referred to as "Beer Variables".

The scope of this analysis is to address the questions as listed above.  This analysis does not currently address any relationship between the number of breweries, state demographic and population data, population consumption behavior, or any other factors against the Beer Variables.  It is Team Variance's understanding that Client X may wish to understanding these additional relationship findings in subsequent studies, and that Team Variance is available at Client X's request to perform subsequent analyses under a seperate statement of work.  

The final deliverables for this engagement are contained in the file titled "Team Variance_6306_CaseStudy1.ppt" (hereinafter "Final Deliverable").  This document, Final Deliverable, as well as all other supporting documents, are contained in this repo available on GitHub.  Client X has been granted access to the repo, but at Client X's request, any/all of the engagement files are available to other forms of delivery (i.e., mailed hard copies; emailed soft copies, etc.).

The project supporting documents include source files as well as created files.  Source files were provided by Client X and include:

- Beers.csv:  this is a raw data file
- Breweries.csv:  this is a raw data file
- Case Study 01.pdf:  this contains the scope of the engagement.
- CaseStudy1Rubric:  this file provides is supplementary to the Case Study 01.pdf file and contains additional guidance to Team Variance.

Files that will be created by the team include rmd. and ppt. files (for calculations and analysis and presentation of results respectively).  This includes a .RMD file (containing code, results, and explanations of code chunks); a knitted HTML file (containing the outputs of the .RMD file), as well as exported files containing manipulated data and a codebook (explaining object definitions).

Upon conclusion/finalization of the project - which is marked by emailed confirmation from Client X - this repo and READ.ME file will be updated to indicate as much.  


Presentations of results will be done during the Live Session 8.
